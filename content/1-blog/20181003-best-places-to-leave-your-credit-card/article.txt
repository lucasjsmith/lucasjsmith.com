### Best:
**1. The Independent**, San Francisco
Easily accessible because the box office has regular hours every weekday. The woman there immediately reassures you that it happens all the time, and the large wad of abandoned cards is readily at hand just to her right. Quick & easy with a smile.

** 2. Bixi Station at Rue de Bullion & St. Joseph Blvd**, Montreal

### Worst:
**1. Keg & Lantern Brewery**, Brooklyn
